## 👩‍🎓 About me

Hi! I'm **Amina Manseur**, a final-year engineering student at **Centrale Méditerranée** and **ENSAE Paris**, specializing in **Data Science**, **Statistics**, and **Machine Learning**.
I enjoy working on problems that blend **mathematical modeling**, **statistical learning**, and **real-world impact**.
After various experiences in academia and industry, I'm considering pursuing a **PhD** in applied statistics or machine learning, where I can contribute to both **methodological development** and **applied insights**.

## 🔎 My recent experiences

- 🏗️ **Bouygues Construction** – Data science apprenticeship  
   • Working on various projects to support operational teams by developing useful digital tools that integrate AI components to streamline the delivery of their outputs.

- 📉 **AMSE (Aix-Marseille School of Economics)** – Research internship  
  • Worked on generating financial time series using diffusion models  
  • Initially explored diffusion models as stochastic models, implementing them and evaluating their performance empirically.

- 🔌 **EDF** – Applied statistics project  
  • Developed prospective scenarios for electric mobility in France  
  • Combined statistical modeling and scenario planning for future mobility trends, population growth and climate change.

- 🏝️ **KAUST (Saudi Arabia)** – 2 research projects  
  • Explored Robust and Private Multi-armed Bandits under α-contamination  
  • Worked on Truthful High Dimensional Sparse Linear Regression (submitted to NeurIPS)

## 📚 Last projects

| Project | Description | Links |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **LLM Text Detection (NLP)** | Developed a binary classifier to distinguish between human-written and LLM-generated texts. Combined various feature sets: advanced embeddings (BERT, RoBERTa, SentenceBERT), traditional NLP embeddings (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF), and interpretable features based on stylistic, complexity, and psychological characteristics.| [GitHub]([https://github.com/AminaManseur29/summary-detection-ml](https://github.com/AminaManseur29/ENSAE_NLP_project) |
| **Data Science Project Production** | Transformed an existing data science project into a production-ready pipeline. Emphasized best coding practices, automation, and reproducibility. Implemented environment management (`venv`), dependency tracking (`requirements.txt`), standardized logging, and a structured Git branching strategy to ensure smooth deployment and collaboration. | [GitHub](https://github.com/AminaManseur29/Miseenprod_projet) |
| **(More coming soon)** | Stay tuned for additional highlighted projects from academic and research work. | – |
